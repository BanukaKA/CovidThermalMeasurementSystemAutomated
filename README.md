# CovidThermalMeasurementSystemAutomated
Circuits Design and Arduino Code of Project CovidThempSystem Automated by Banuka Ambegoda OBO Dharmaraja College Kandy

Our project is to build a long distance temperature measuring and infection recognition system and in here based on Arduino...
In this we use the long range thermal sensor MLX90614 sensor for  calculating body temperature
And An Arduino Unno
Arduino Uno Connector
Batteries or power units
Few Red and Green LEDs
16 x 2 LCD Display panel
A Buzzer
A Breadboard
and Jumper Wires
These are the electronics that we need....

And we need to create a box to hold the whole structure in a compact cube to make it portable and durable.
That must be created with a material like acrilic, plastic or wood.....

Everything else is planned and we need money and knowledge to succeed here. The expenses and costs will be informed to you soon

For creating it we need to devide work
I have programmed all the code and created the circuit for now...
This must be updated and we havent yet planned about power units in circuits have a look at the code and schematics and the circuit
And add the libraries to your aarduino IDE in your PC......
Other updates will be definitely informed to you through MS teams and Whatsappp and stay in the whats app group actively.........
